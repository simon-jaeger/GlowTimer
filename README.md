# GlowTimer

A simple pomodoro timer.

> The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
> The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals,
> traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
> These intervals are named pomodoros, the anglicized plural of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato),
> after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

It's possible to set an alternative interval by passing a variable `pomodoro`
through the query string:
